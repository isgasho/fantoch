### `fantoch`: framework for evaluating (planet-scale) consensus protocols

#### Protocols currently implemented
- [EPaxos](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~dga/papers/epaxos-sosp2013.pdf): [(source)](https://github.com/vitorenesduarte/fantoch/tree/master/fantoch_ps/src/protocol/epaxos.rs)
- [FPaxos](https://fpaxos.github.io/), and thus Paxos as a special case: [(source)](https://github.com/vitorenesduarte/fantoch/tree/master/fantoch_ps/src/protocol/fpaxos.rs)
  - implemented following [Paxos Made Moderately Complex](http://paxos.systems/), which enables a certain degree of parallelism at the leader
- [Atlas](https://vitorenes.org/publication/enes-atlas/): [(source)](https://github.com/vitorenesduarte/fantoch/tree/master/fantoch_ps/src/protocol/atlas.rs)
- Newt: [(source)](https://github.com/vitorenesduarte/fantoch/tree/master/fantoch_ps/src/protocol/newt.rs)

Next:
- Mencius: a variation that we call Flexible Mencius (as in Flexible Paxos) + an optimization that should make it very efficient for low conflict workloads

#### What does it do?

- all protocols implement the [`Protocol`](https://github.com/vitorenesduarte/fantoch/blob/master/fantoch/src/protocol/mod.rs) trait
- this specification can then be used for both
  - geo-distributed simulations that only output latency (infinite CPU is assumed)
  - actually running the protocols (in any setting)
- this is achieved by providing a "simulator" and a "runner" that are protocol-agnostic and are only aware of the `Protocol` (and [`Executor`](https://github.com/vitorenesduarte/fantoch/blob/master/fantoch/src/executor/mod.rs)) trait
